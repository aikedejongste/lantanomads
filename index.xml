You can pay with credit/debit card in the bigger restaurants and shops but usually there is a fee and a minimum amount.

ATMs The Yellow ATMs will give you 30.000 THB, the others are limited to 20.</description></item><item><title>Parties</title><link>https://lantanomads.com/parties/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lantanomads.com/parties/</guid><description>There is a more or less fixed schedule for the parties on the island.
